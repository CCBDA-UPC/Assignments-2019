# Cloud Computing for Big Data Analytics practical jobs

In Cloud Computing for Big Data Analytics, there will be two sorts of student jobs: lab assignments and one project. Some lab sessions include pre-session homework.

Students are expected to complete and submit the assigned pre-lab homework before each lab session.

## Lab assignments
Students will begin by creating an essential toolbox to get them started in the Cloud. It will prepare them to be able to practice with APIs, the doors in the Cloud. That will also allow students to be able to mine the deluge of data coming from the Cloud or using new advanced analytics services available nowadays in the Cloud. Finally, we will look under the hood of these high-level analytics services in the Cloud, either regarding software or hardware, to understand how to meet high-performance requirements. The final goal is to provide code examples that smoothly can get the student started.

- Lab 1: [Basic "Knowledge Toolbox" to get started in the Cloud][Lab1] **10%**
- Lab 2: [Doors in the Cloud][Lab2]                                        **10%**
- Lab 3: [Extracting and Analyzing data from the Cloud][Lab3]              **15%**
- Lab 4: [Interacting with users and services in the Cloud][Lab4]          **15%** + **5% (optional part)**
- Lab 5: [Under the hood of the Cloud: Advanced Analytics Services][Lab5]       **15%** + **5% (optional part)**
- Lab 6: [Using AWS PaaS to create a web application][Lab6]        **15%** + **5% (optional part)**

## Course Project
The course project can be completed in groups of 1, 2 or 3 students.  Before starting the development, students require the teacher's approval of their course project proposal.

**Six levels:**
* **Minimum (max grade obtained 60%)**: One possible project idea is to prepare a presentation regarding technologies related to this part of the course (using slides).

* **Medium (max grade obtained 90%)**: Another project alternative is to create a self-contained,  practical guide (hands-on guide) that helps the reader in learning one of the latest cloud technologies.

* **Full (option 1)**:  The standard project is to create an application using existing APIs. [Starting here for more information](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/02/6-deep-learning-applications-beginner-python/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+AnalyticsVidhya+%28Analytics+Vidhya%29). For example:
  * Colorize photos using Deep Learning  with Algorithmia API
  * Building a ChatBot using Watson API
  * News Aggregator based on Sentiment Analysis using Aylien API

* **Full (option 2)**:  Carry out one of the projects suggested by the professor during this course.

* **Advanced (option 1) (+10% bonus)**  The project offers an excellent opportunity for students to dive into the course contents by implementing a protoype (proof of concept implementation of a business idea created by the students) using some of the latest Cloud technology. Your teacher will be deligted to help you.

* **Advanced (option 2) (+10% bonus)**  Surprise the teacher with a project proposal that he accepts.

## Deadlines
#### Deadlines for Labs
The indicated deadlines are mere suggestions for you to ideally complete each hands-on assignment. They are meant to help you keeping on track and maintaining an appropriate pace throughout the program. There is no penalty if you miss the deadlines.
#### Deadline for the course Project
The deadlines indicated in the course syllabus are a hard deadline.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to thank Prof. Jordi Torres for developing the initial version of these lab sessions and thanks also due to some of his former students for their help proofreading and improving the documentation: Eloy Gil, Dani Cea, Xisco Sastre, Maurici Yagüez and Mauro Gómez.
